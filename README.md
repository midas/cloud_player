# cloud_player  #

CloudPlayer is an implementation of the undocumented (read: may break
at any time) API of Amazon's Cloud Player. It's pretty basic right
now, handling authentication and getting tracks, albums, artists
and playlists. The eventual goal is to create a local daemon that can
play music from Cloud Player as well as a client for interacting with
it. This would allow use of Cloud Player outside of the browser.
